# JumpDiveClock

A simple speedrun timer for X11.

## FAQ

### Why?

I tried some timers for Linux and didn't like them, so I decided to write my own. How hard could it be?

### Where did this name come from?

I speedrun a Mario fangame where the fastest way to move without equipment is to repeatedly jump and dive.

## Usage

* calculate pace based on the average time to complete a split or comparing to the performance of the last run;
* [maybe] autosplitter.
