# JumpDiveClock

A simple speedrun timer for X11. Intended for my personal use.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* xinput.

## FAQ

### Why?

I tried some timers for Linux and didn't like them, so I decided to write my own.

### Where did this name come from?

I speedrun a Mario fangame where the fastest way to move without equipment is to repeatedly jump and
dive.
