# JumpDiveClock

A simple speedrun timer for X11.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* xinput.

## FAQ

### Why?

I tried some timers for Linux and didn't like them, so I decided to write my own. How hard could it be?

### Where did this name come from?

I speedrun a Mario fangame where the fastest way to move without equipment is to repeatedly jump and dive.

## Usage

## TODO

* splitting;
* green, reds & golds;
* reset statistics;
* compare against pb;
* calculate pace based on the average time to complete a split or comparing to the performance of the last run;
* scrolling segments when there are too many of them;
* [maybe] autosplitter.
